    title: 'Genesis 4',
    content: `1 Adam made love to his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, "With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man." 
2 Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. 
3 In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord. 
4 And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favor on Abel and his offering, 
5 but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.
6 Then the Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? 
7 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it."
8 Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
9 Then the Lord said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"
10 The Lord said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. 
11 Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 
12 When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."
13 Cain said to the Lord, "My punishment is more than I can bear. 
14 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
15 But the Lord said to him, "Not so; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. 
16 So Cain went out from the Lord's presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
17 Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 
18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.
19 Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah. 
20 Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock. 
21 His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes. 
22 Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.
23 Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.
24 If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."
25 Adam made love to his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him." 
26 Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call on the name of the Lord.`,
    summary: 'Cain and Abel bring offerings to God, but when God favors Abel\'s offering, Cain murders his brother out of jealousy. God punishes Cain but also protects him. The chapter concludes with the genealogy of Cain\'s descendants and the birth of Seth, who replaces Abel.',

    content: `1 When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, 
2 the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. 
3 Then the Lord said, "My Spirit will not contend with humans forever, for they are mortal; their days will be a hundred and twenty years."
4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.
5 The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. 
6 The Lord regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. 
7 So the Lord said, "I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them." 
8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord.
9 This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God. 
10 Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth.
11 Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence. 
12 God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. 
13 So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. 
14 So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. 
15 This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high. 
16 Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. 
17 I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. 
18 But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. 
19 You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. 
20 Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive. 
21 You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them."
22 Noah did everything just as God commanded him.`,

3 and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth. 
4 Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made."
5 And Noah did all that the Lord commanded him.
6 Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth. 
7 And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood. 
8 Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,

11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, on the seventeenth day of the second month—on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened. 
12 And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
13 On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.

15 Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.

19 They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered. 
20 The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than fifteen cubits. 
21 Every living thing that moved on land perished—birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind. 
22 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died. 
23 Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; people and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.
